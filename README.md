### SDK Interface Description

#### Connect to Service

```c
/**
 * @brief SDK initialization interface
 * @brief Connects to the service and registers the callback
 * @param context Callback context, used to pass user-defined data to the callback function
 * @param cliCallback Callback function pointer, used to listen to server messages
 * @param mask Callback mask, used to filter certain server messages. Pass 0xffffffff
 */
PXREACLIENTSDK_EXPORT int PXREAInit(void* context,pfPXREAClientCallback cliCallback,unsigned mask);
```

#### Disconnect from Service

```c
/**
 * @brief Termination interface
 * @brief Disconnects from the service
 */
PXREACLIENTSDK_EXPORT int PXREADeinit();
```

#### Send JSON Message to VR Device

```c
/**
 * @brief Sends a JSON command to the device
 * @param devID Device SN, refer to device discovery callback
 * @param parameterJson Function and parameters, in JSON format
 * @return 0 Success
 * @return -1 Failure
 */
PXREACLIENTSDK_EXPORT int PXREADeviceControlJson(const char *devID,const char *parameterJson);
```

#### VR Data Reception

Mainly obtained through callback functions

The callback function is specified when connecting to the service (see PXREAInit function)

Format as follows

```c
/**
 * @brief Client callback, used to receive server messages
 * @param context Callback context, passed by parameter 1 context of #PXREAInit
 * @param type Callback type
 * @param status Callback status code, reserved field, currently meaningless
 * @param userData Callback data pointer, determined by parameter 2 type
 */
typedef void(*pfPXREAClientCallback)(void* context,PXREAClientCallbackType type,int status,void* userData);
```

Callback type description

```c
enum PXREAClientCallbackType
{
    /// @brief Server connected
    PXREAServerConnect          = 1<<2,
    /// @brief Server disconnected
    PXREAServerDisconnect       = 1<<3,
    /// @brief Device online
    PXREADeviceFind             = 1<<4,
    /// @brief Device offline
    PXREADeviceMissing          = 1<<5,
    /// @brief Device connected
    PXREADeviceConnect          = 1<<9,
    /// @brief Device state JSON description
    PXREADeviceStateJson        = 1<<25,
    /// @brief Mask, used to enable all callbacks
    PXREAFullMask               = 0xffffffff
};

```

The device data obtained by the user is mainly through the PXREADeviceStateJson callback, and the corresponding callback function parameters are as follows

| Callback Type         | context | type                 | userData | status |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| JSON format device state description | User-defined   | PXREADeviceStateJson |          | 0      |



### PICO Device JSON Data Description

Currently, there are five types of tracking data: head, controller, hand gesture, full-body motion capture, and independent tracking. All data will be sent as a JSON string with the following basic structure.

```json
{"functionName":"Tracking","value":"{"Head":"Head","Controller":"Controller","Hand":"Hand","Body":"Body Motion Capture","Motion":"Tracker Independent Tracking","timeStampNs":"Timestamp","Input":"Input method 0 head 1 controller 2 gesture"}"}
```

Field description

* If the control panel does not enable tracking for the corresponding part, the corresponding key will not exist.

* value is the actual data string. When using, please convert the string to JSON and remove "\\".

```json
JsonData data = JsonMapper.ToObject(HeadJson);
string valueStr = data["value"].ToString().Replace("\\", "");
JsonData valueJson = JsonMapper.ToObject(valueStr);
```

**Pose**: A string representing seven float data for pose, separated by commas. The first three floats represent position (x, y, z), and the last four floats represent rotation (quaternion: x, y, z, w);

**Coordinate System**: Left-handed coordinate system (X right, Y up, Z in), the origin is set as the head position when the application starts. The following figure marks the position and orientation of the Head point.

#### 4. Full-body Motion Capture Tracking


Full-body motion capture requires additional Pico Swift devices (at least two) and proper adaptation and calibration in the Pico headset.

![](images/image-25.png)

> Note: Each time the headset is activated, calibration is required.

**Human Joint Reference**

The full-body motion capture function of the PICO SDK supports tracking the 24 human joints shown in the figure below.

The following are related concept descriptions:

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Coordinate System      | Same world coordinate system as the headset data.                                                         |
| Root Joint Node    | 0 (Pelvis)                                                                 |
| Parent/Child Joint Node  | Nodes 1 to 23, the one closer to the root joint is the parent, the one closer to the limb end is the child.                                        |
| Bone       | A rigid body between two nodes, its pose is stored in the parent node structure closer to the root joint. For example: the pose angle of the lower leg bone is stored in the Knee joint structure. More examples:   |

The following is the BodyTrackerRole enumeration, corresponding one-to-one with the joints in the reference diagram.

```c#
public enum BodyTrackerRole

## C++ API Usage Example

1. Integrate the SDK file path into the project's CMakeList.txt:

```cmake
    target_include_directories(ConsoleDemo PUBLIC ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../SDK/include)

    target_link_directories(ConsoleDemo PUBLIC ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/../../../SDK/linux/64)
```

* API call example:

```c++
#include <PXREARobotSDK.h>

// SDK message callback function
inline void OnPXREAClientCallback(void* context,PXREAClientCallbackType type,int status,void* userData)
{
    auto& sdkCaller = (*(SDKCaller*)context);
    switch (type)
    {
    case PXREAServerConnect:
         //qDebug() <<"server connect"  << Qt::endl;
    case PXREAServerDisconnect:
        //qDebug() <<"server disconnect"  << Qt::endl;
        break;
    case PXREADeviceFind:
        //qDebug() <<"device find"<<(const char*)userData<< Qt::endl;
        break;
    case PXREADeviceMissing:
        //qDebug() <<"device missing"<<(const char*)userData<< Qt::endl;
        break;
    case PXREADeviceStateJson:
        break;
    }
}

    // Initialize SDK and register callback function
    void testInit()
    {
        PXREAInit(this, OnPXREAClientCallback, PXREAFullMask);
    }

    // Release SDK
    void testDeinit()
    {
        PXREADeinit();
    }

    // Send message
    void testDeviceControlJson(const QString& devID,const QString& parameterJson)
    {
        PXREADeviceControlJson(devID.toUtf8().constData(),parameterJson.toUtf8().constData());
    }

```
